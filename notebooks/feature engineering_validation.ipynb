       "  'post_body': \"I pay for Youtube premium so I don't notice the ads, but over at a friend's house, he showed me a Youtube video and before the video was an ad defending a recent Trump admin lawsuit against the state of California. I'm not sure if previous administrations advertised their ongoing actions like that, and I'm pretty insulated from media in my daily life, but it got me thinking.\\n\\nYou've got a nationwide army of conservative talk radio, shock jocks, and manosphere podcasters. There are networks like PragerU and the Heritage Foundation, all advancing and advocating for a contrarian conservative worldview. You've got the conman in chief, lying and manipulating like he breathes, and a Republican Party that isn't good at anything but staying on message, whatever that happens to be today.\\n\\nIt's my opinion that the above sources are harmful to democracy, to our society, to our economy, and even beyond the harmful policies themselves, work as an ongoing astringent washing away trust in institutions, people who are different from us, and our common society. But the messages continue, and get louder and louder until the American populace can't seem to tell the difference between the slimeball in office now and other politicians. Or that the main effect of the message is to convince you to let these conmen sell off everything good about our government.\\n\\nBut is there anyone, anywhere, who is actually producing media that advocates for trust in government, or ideas about how government could actually serve our population? Even on the left, most recent engagement has ignored successes like the infrastructure bill or the Inflation Reduction Act. Most political chatter on the left seems to be about Palestine maybe, but no one's really talking about why we vote blue, what we hope to achieve, or what kinds of solutions would be possible.\\n\\nI haven't engaged with political media in several years, aside from online forums that now seem too compromised by bots to continue engaging with, but for the past few years I've been consuming mainly clean energy news. The view of public policy from the level of that industry alone is so much saner than the discourse around politics in general.\\n\\nPolicy wonking can really solve some problems. I just wonder, are there any people on the left actually talking about solutions in a public forum? The conversation around politics has never really been sane in my life, but it does make you wonder how anything ever gets done. I'm of the opinion that government is actually capable of being competent, but it's a lot harder when half the electorate seems to constantly be wondering whether we should just tear it all down, and most of the other half is defeatist, arranged in a circular firing squad, and seeking the moral high ground at the expense of winning elections, and no one on either side seems to really believe in government policy that could work. \\n\\nAnd yet what we take for granted as modern society is largely built on the vast endowment of public works projects done earlier in the last century, along with a commitment to democracy, strong property rights, and good jurisprudence, all things that are being eroded by the current administration. Worse still, most of the electorate doesn't even really seem to understand the importance of these things, or how they made the United States stand out at a time in history when most other countries were war torn, impoverished, or underdeveloped.\\n\\nWe've all seen those clips of people from the 40s and 50s speaking in a theatrical mid-Atlantic accent, explaining various government policies or newfangled technologies. Does anyone do this these days? Is there any source of media anywhere extolling the virtues of democracy, or touting the value of the principles of our government, or talking about how government policy gets things done?\\n\\nI think the Inflation Reduction Act is an ingenious piece of legislation and public policy, and it single handedly jumpstarted the largest increase in American manufacturing since the 1970s. And yet, no one even knows about it, or just thinks it's a waste or something. It's generated nearly a quarter trillion dollars of private investment so far, while helping us get a lot closer to solving climate change than we otherwise would be. I wish the Biden administration had released one of those 1940s presentations with a guy in front of a Powerpoint calmly explaining all of its good features, and propagated that out on TV and the internet or something. Plenty of people would have cynically dismissed a presentation like that, sure, but plenty of other people would have been informed about an example of government actually working well and meaningfully turning a problem into a win-win solution. Right now those people don't even know it exists.\",\n",
